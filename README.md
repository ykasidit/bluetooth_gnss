Bluetooth GNSS
--------------

Connect your Android phone to external Bluetooth GPS, GLONASS, Galileo and BeiDou receivers and use the received location in your android phone via the mock location provider.

Official app is available on Google Play as [Bluetooth GNSS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clearevo.bluetooth_gnss&hl=en&gl=US).

Note: This project is maintained in open spirit and evolves slowly as/when I get time and energy outside my day job.
If itâ€™s useful to your research or work, you can [sponsor or support development via GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/ykasidit) â€” every small gesture helps sustain independent engineering. ðŸŒž


Build instructions
-----------

* Install the the [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) as per official instructions including the 'Android setup' and make sure that the Android SDK is installed.

* Make sure the flutter sdk version matches that in pubspec.yaml:

`flutter downgrade v<flutter ver in pubspec.yaml>`

* In this folder run:
`flutter pub get`

* Install Rust - follow instructions in:
`https://rustup.rs/`

* Install flutter_rust_bridge: match that of flutter_rust_bridge in pubspec.yaml - see https://cjycode.com/flutter_rust_bridge/quickstart)
example:
```
rustup install 1.90
rustup default 1.90
cargo install flutter_rust_bridge_codegen --version 2.11.1
```

* If you modify the rust code or upgrade versions in above then you need to update update with:
`flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate`

You might need below if above faces issues:
```
flutter_rust_bridge_codegen integrate
```

You might have to restore `main.dart` after above `generate` command:
`git checkout lib/main.dart`


* If you don't already have an android signing key, create one as per:
<https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android#create-an-upload-keystore>

* Create the file `key.properties` in parent of this folder and add your keystore information:
```
storeFile=/path/to/keystore.jks
storePassword=*********
keyAlias=bluetooth_gnss
keyPassword=**********
``` 
* Connect an android phone with adb working
`adb devices`

* Try build and run the app in debug mode:
`flutter run`
If all went well, you would see the app now run in your connected phone.

* Try build a release android installer (apk) file:
`flutter build apk`
If all went well, it would create the apk file in the folder:
`build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`

* Develop in Android studio:
  - Open android studio, and choose 'Projects' > 'Open' to this folder (or File > Open... menu) and you can edit the source code then run 'main.dart' from there. This is suitable for editing the dart files in the lib folder.
  - UI changes to main.dart can be seen immediately (hot-reload) on phone but function changes or java/engine part changes won't, you need to 'stop' then 'run' main.dart again for the changes to take effect.
  - Auto-completion of java code (in the android subfolder) and running of the java unit-tests won't work as this Android Studio is run in a 'flutter' project mode.
  - To edit the engine part and run the java unit tests, simply open the 'android' subfolder of this folder in a new Android Studio instance: File > Open ... choose: bluetooth_gnss > android. After Android Studio is ready, then you can try run some tests like browse on the left panel to libecodroidgnss_parse > java > (test) and right click on 'test_nmea_parse' > Run.

* Use the `flutter build apk` command when you want to build a release apk file.

Initiate connection using external intent
-----------------------------------------
I'm using [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm) to send the intent, but other methods are possible

### Configure the task
On the `TASKS` tab, create a new task (e.g. _Connect GPS_) and add the action _Send Intent_. It is configured as follows:
* Action: `bluetooth.CONNECT`
* Cat: `Default`
* Mime Type: `text/plain`
* Data: _&lt;empty&gt;_
* Extra: _&lt;see json string below&gt;_
* Package: `com.clearevo.bluetooth_gnss`
* Class: _&lt;empty&gt;_
* Target: `Broadcast Receiver`

**json string in Extra field**

Add this string without newlines. All values are optional. Note that `config` is without double quotes

```
config: {
    "bdaddr": "%bt_address",
    "secure": false,
    "reconnect": true,
    "log_bt_rx": true,
    "disable_ntrip": true,
    "extra": {
        "ntrip_user": "taskeruser",
        "ntrip_mountpoint": "taskermount",
        "ntrip_host": "taskerhost",
        "ntrip_port": "2000",
        "ntrip_pass": "taskerpass"
    }
}
```

**Example**

If you only want to override the bluetooth address, you can send this as extra:

```
config: {bdaddr:"%bt_address"}
```

If you don't use the BT Connection Event (see below) but the BT Connection state, you have to use the real address of your device:

```
config: {bdaddr: "00:11:22:33:44:55:66"}
```

If you want to disable ntrip as well:

```
config: {bdaddr: "00:11:22:33:44:55:66", disable_ntrip: true}
```

### Configure the event
On the `PROFILES` tab, you can use a state change or a event. In this example, I'm using the [BT Connection event](https://tasker.joaoapps.com/userguide/en/help/eh_bt_connect_disconnect.html) with the following conditions:

* `%bt_connected EQ true`
* `$bt_address EQ 00:11:22:33:44:55:66`, the bluetooth address of the GPS receiver

This will trigger the event only when my GPS receiver is connected. You can add multiple devices here, which is why I choose this method: in the action, the variable `%bt_address` will be available as well and I'll use that to pass to Bluetooth GNSS.
